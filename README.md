# SOI2023: Similar Object Interference Challenge Dataset for Single Object Tracking

We develop a mining method for extracting similar object interference （SOI） sub-datasets from SOT datasets that does not rely on human intervention. This approach consists of two main components: determining SOI challenge and screening SOI sequences. We obtain a SOI dataset from representative SOT Datasets using our proposed method, called SOI2023. This dataset serves as an ideal environment to help facilitate the study related to similar object interference challenge.
